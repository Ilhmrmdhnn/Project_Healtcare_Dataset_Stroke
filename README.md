# Project Healthcare Dataset Stroke

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stroke occurrences using a healthcare dataset. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to stroke and develop predictive models to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and prevention.

## Key Features
1. Data Collection:
* Using a comprehensive healthcare dataset that includes various patient attributes such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and other relevant health metrics.

2. Data Preprocessing:
* Handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data.
* Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with stroke occurrences.
* Visualizing data using histograms, box plots, correlation matrices, and scatter plots to identify trends and patterns.

4. Feature Engineering:
* Creating new features that might improve the predictive power of the models.
* Selecting the most relevant features for the predictive models.

5. Model Development:
* Implementing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for stroke prediction.
* Training the models on the dataset and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

6. Model Evaluation:
* Evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models.

7. Visualization:
* Creating visualizations to present model performance and insights.
* Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization.
